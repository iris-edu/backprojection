 DESCRIPTION:

    This is the Python 3 code behind the IRIS DMC's BackProjection Data product (http://ds.iris.edu/spud/backprojection)
    and it can producing the individual plots and animations that are part of the BackProjection  product
    (http://ds.iris.edu/spud/backprojection).

    The code can be configured via its parameter file "back_projection_param.py" and via the command line arguments.
    Currently parameters are optimized for use with four virtual networks defined in the parameter file.

 PYTHON REQUIREMENTS:

       - this package has been tested under Python 3.8.12 on macOS 11.6, and Linux CentOS-7 (may work with older
         Python 3 versions)

       - additional required Python module(s) with the tested version:
             . basemap              (tested with version 1.2.2)
             . obspy                (tested with version 1.2.2)
             . ffmpeg               (tested with version 4.4.1)
             . basemap-data-hires   (tested with version 1.2.2-0)

 PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

       unpack the package
            . "src" directory contains the main code.
            . The parameter file is under the "param" directory.
            . "lib" directory has the library Python files.
            . "assets" directory contains the global trenches data file used for plotting.

 CONFIGURE THE PACKAGE:

        With Python configured, you should be able to run the package examples without further modifications. However:
        - if necessary, update the Python path on the first line of the src/aftershock_fdsn_maps.py
        - if desired, configure the package by updating pthe aram/back_projection_param.py file
        - package will create the following directories as needed:
            data: output data files (station list and peak amplitude values)
            image: output images
            log: log directory
            metadata: metadata directory (not used)
            scratch: work directory (cleaned up after each run)
            video: output videos and video screen shots

 PACKAGE TEST:

    Run src/src/back_projection_r2.py with "-h" option (assuming you have properly configured your Python
    installation) and it will print a USAGE messages.

    Run the first example (the low resolution example). This will take the code through all the steps. Check the image,
    video and data directories for the outputs.
